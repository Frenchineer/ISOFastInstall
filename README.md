# ISOFastInstall
simple powershell script to create bootable usb devices

it will always choose disk1 as the usb target, this may cause big problem if you have 2 disks other than the usb you want to flash.
always use one usb stick at a time, if you have multiple device plugged you won't be able to choose wich is going to be erased.

Place your ISOs in the ISO folder (use this format to be sure there is no syntax errors: OSversion.iso exemples: WINDOWS10.iso, KALI2022_2amd64.iso, dots in name will probably crash everything).
Launch with start.ps1, select options, wait and your usb device is ready.

Feel free to edit or use some code but please credit me with my github link.

Do not excpect much update or anything else from me, I will work on it only when I feel like doing it.

I made this program for my training period.
I do not take any responsabilities for data loss or material damage, this is my first script and i'm not aware of a lot of things.
