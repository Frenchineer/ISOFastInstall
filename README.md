# ISOFastInstall
simple powershell script to create bootable usb devices

Place your ISOs in the ISO folder (use this format to be sure there is no syntax errors: OSversion.iso exemples: WINDOWS10.iso, KALI2022_2amd64.iso, dots in name will probably crash everything).
Launch with start.ps1, select options, wait and your usb device is ready.

Feel free to edit or use some code but please credit me with my github link.

Do not excpect much update or anything else from me, I will work on it only when I feel like doing it.
