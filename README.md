# ISOFastInstall
simple powershell script to create bootable usb devices

Place your ISOs in the ISO folder (use this format to be sure there is no syntax errors: OSversion.iso).
Launch, select options, wait and your usb device is ready.


Do not excpect much update or anything else from me, I will work on it only when I feel like doing it.
